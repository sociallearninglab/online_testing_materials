# Parent Consent for Online Testing   

This is the parent consent form we send to parents in our recruitment email before the testing day.

## DESCRIPTION:  

Our studies are designed to be fun, age-appropriate activities for young children, and 
easily conducted online using virtual meeting software such as Zoom). Your child will be 
asked to play a short game with our researchers. Your child will be introduced to storybooks, 
pictures, or pre-recorded video clips; in some studies we may present toys and puppets. 
Afterwards we will ask short questions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are just 
interested in what children think!

## RISKS AND BENEFITS: 
We will pace each session appropriately, and participation in our research has no foreseeable 
risks or discomforts to you or your child. If your child wants to stop participating for 
any reason, we will end the session immediately with no penalty.  We cannot and do not 
guarantee that you will receive any benefits from participation, apart from the satisfaction 
of contributing to scientific research. 
 
## PAYMENTS:  
You will not receive a cash payment for your participation in this research.

## SUBJECT’S RIGHTS: 
Your child’s participation is voluntary and your child has the right to withdraw his/her 
consent or discontinue participation at any time without any negative consequences. 

We video-record our sessions so we can recall what happens during the game. By giving 
consent for your child to participate, you are allowing us to video-record the study. The 
recording will be assigned a code number that is not linked to any personally identifiable 
information, and all data will be stored in a secure storage/server accessible only to our 
research team (Level 1 Consent).

You can also authorize us to show this video to other scientists and students (Level 2) or 
to the broader public (Level 3). These additional levels of consent help us teach students 
and communicate our research to others, but they are optional.  At the end of the session, 
our researcher would be happy to explain these levels and answer any questions so you can 
choose the level you are most comfortable with.

will replace your signature.
