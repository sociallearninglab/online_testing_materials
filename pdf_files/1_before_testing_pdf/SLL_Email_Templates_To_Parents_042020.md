# Recruitment Email Templates for Parents

These are the email templates that the Stanford Social Learning Lab uses to recruit 
parents for their online testing.

## How to use
 
[Within brackets are instructions for what we did.]
``` 
highlighted within code blocks are our email contents.
```


## 0. Distributing Online Testing Poster to Parents 

[First, we send out posters for parents to participate in our online study. For parents 
who are interested, they will scan the code in the poster which is linked to a Qualtrics 
survey asking for children's basic information. After parents fill in the survey, the 
information is saved in RedCAP, a secure web application we use to store our databases. ]


## 1.  Scheduling Email to Parents 

[Send personal email to parents whose info is in RedCAP and who have a child in the age 
range of study (via our Gmail account: stanford.kidsonlinea@gmail.com, NOT via Calendly).
We use Calendly, a free online appointment scheduling software to schedule parents for 
an online testing slot. Currently, we created two links (two testing rooms): one for younger 
children from 3-6, and the other from 7-9.]

Hello [parent's name],

My name is _NAME__, and I work in the Social Learning Lab in Stanford's Psychology Department.

social interactions. 

You recently filled out a form to express interest in our research games. We greatly 
appreciate your participation! We currently have games for ages three to nine. Below are 
links(links to Calendly) to our calendar which shows our current availability. 

If your child is between the ages of three and six please sign them up using this link: 
https://calendly.com/example_link/online-studies-3to6

If your child is between the ages of seven to nine please sign them up using this link:

Please sign up for a half slot which works best for you. If you have multiple children

convenience, please use the seven to nine link to sign up all of your children. When you 
sign up, you will receive an automated confirmation for the date and time you choose;
you can also reschedule or cancel the meeting using the links in the automated email.

Hello [parent's name],

Thank you so much for your willingness to participate with Stanford's online studies! 
[date/time of appointment] works perfectly. We look forward to seeing you then.

We will meet via Zoom; if you are not familiar with Zoom, it's a video-conference platform 
and works similarly to Skype. If you do not have Zoom installed on your computer, please 
do so by visiting the Zoom website. Please consult the attached "parent instruction guide" 
to activate Zoom and enter the game room.

Please also take a look at the attached consent information and read it carefully. 
You won't have to sign anything, but at the beginning of the session we will ask you 
whether you have read and understood this information to get your verbal consent. The key 
information in this form is that your child's data will be securely stored and will only 
be used for research purposes, and that you or your child can stop playing at any time.

One final note - It is very important that your child interacts with our researchers 
WITHOUT any input from you! These are scientific studies disguised as child-friendly games, 
and for adults they might seem "silly" at times; sometimes if your child is slow 
to respond, you may want to chime in. But please try to let your child interact with our  
researchers, and refrain from talking, laughing, pointing, or asking questions. Thank you   
for your cooperation and we would be happy to answer any questions after the study is over.  

You will receive a confirmation email 24 hours before our meeting with the Zoom link. In 
this meantime, let us know if you have any further questions!

We look forward to playing with you and [child's name]!

Sincerely,
__NAME___

[event date].

## 5.  Email Follow Up/ Thank you

[This is the final email sent after the testing day].

```
Hello [parent's name],

Thank you for playing research games on [event date] at [event time]. We had a lot of fun 
and we hope that you did too! We greatly appreciate your support of our research.  
Attached is a certificate of completion for [child's name], the fantastic junior scientist!

When you have a moment, please fill out this short demographics survey to help our 
researchers know a little more about our participants. This information will allow us to 
more accurately communicate who is contributing to our science and to improve the diversity 
of our research participants.

Feel free to let us know if you have any remaining questions. If you would like to learn 
more about the lab, here is our website: http://sll.stanford.edu/.

Hope to see you again next time!

Sincerely,
__NAME___
