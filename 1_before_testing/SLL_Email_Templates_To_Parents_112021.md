# Recruitment Email Templates for Parents

These are the email templates that the Stanford Social Learning Lab uses to recruit 
parents for their online testing.

## How to use
 
[Within brackets are instructions for what we did.]
``` 
highlighted within code blocks are our email contents.
```


## 0. Distributing Online Testing Poster to Parents 

[First, we send out posters for parents to participate in our online study. For parents 
who are interested, they will scan the code in the poster which is linked to a Qualtrics 
survey asking for children's basic information. After parents fill in the survey, the 
information is saved in RedCAP, a secure web application we use to store our databases. ]


## 1.  Scheduling Email to Parents 

[Send personal email to parents whose info is in RedCAP and who have a child in the age 
range of study (via our Gmail account: stanford.kidsonline@gmail.com, NOT via Calendly).
We use Calendly, a free online appointment scheduling software to schedule parents for 
an online testing slot. Currently, we created two links (two testing rooms): one for younger 
children from 3-6, and the other from 7-9.

Nov 2021 update: We have since made a few updates to our system, namely:  
- We have since migrated to using YouCanBookMe for scheduling.  
- To accommodate our growing numbers of participants and studies, we also created more testing 
rooms; we now have two kinds of testing rooms 1) study-specific zoom rooms for each study 
being run - and for repeat participants 2) a single general testing room for first time 
participants  
- We offer $5 gift cards to families as a token of appreciation for their participation (this is 
technically a gift, not a payment)].

Hello [parent's name],

You recently filled out a form expressing interest in Stanford University's Developmental 
Labs' online research games. We greatly appreciate your interest and willingness to 
participate with us!

Stanford Developmental Labs is a group which studies how children learn and think in a variety 
of domains. If you want to learn more about how our research works or about our current studies, 
you can check out our website: http://sll.stanford.edu/participate_online.html. We have an 
informational video that explains the process as well as study descriptions. Below are links to 
our calendar which shows our current availability for each age. Feel free to sign up for a 
half hour slot which works best for you and your child!

If your child is 6-14 months old, please sign up using this link: 
https://talktoyourbaby.youcanbook.me/

If your child is 3 years old, please sign up using this link:  
https://age3.youcanbook.me/

If your child is 4 years old, please sign up using this link:   
https://age4.youcanbook.me/

If your child is 5 years old, please sign up using this link:  
https://age5.youcanbook.me/

We also wanted to let you know that we are currently offering $5 gift cards as a token of appreciation
for your child's participation! Your child will receive a gift card for each 30 minute appointment they 
participate in, not for each activity completed. If you haven't already filled out your gift card preferences, 
you can do so on this google form: 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNrusKr1XNj_pK0asAX6j1lJApfIiv1VTjGzvskljDb0sJyQ/viewform. It may 
take 1-7 days after your appointment for you to receive your card. Be on the lookout for an email from Amazon 
(or Starbucks/CVS)! The gift card will be sent to this email address. 
If you would like the gift card to be sent to a different email address, please let us know before your next session. 

When you sign up, you will receive an automated confirmation for the date and time you choose; you can also 
reschedule or cancel the meeting using the links in the automated email. If you are unable to make any of 
these times, feel free to contact us to schedule a new time. 

Thanks again for your interest in our online studies! We hope to see you soon and feel free to reach out if 
you have any questions! If you would rather opt-out of receiving these emails, no worries at all! Just click 
here to unsubscribe. 

Sincerely, 
__NAME___

## 2.  Confirmation Email

[This is automated by YouCanBookMe, which will create a google calendar invite for parents.]


## 3.  Welcome and Directions Email
 
[Send personal email to parents who have signed up ASAP, with **two attachments**: [Zoom 
instructions](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/1_before_testing/SLL_Parent_Instruction_Guide_042020.key), and the [Consent information](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/1_before_testing/SLL_Online_Consent_Form_042020.md), via 
stanford.kidsonline@gmail.com, NOT via YouCanBookMe.]

Hello [parent's name],

Thank you so much for your willingness to participate with Stanford's online studies! 
[date/time of appointment] works perfectly. We look forward to seeing you then.

We will meet via Zoom; if you are not familiar with Zoom, it's a video-conference platform 
and works similarly to Skype. If you do not have Zoom installed on your computer, please 
do so by visiting the Zoom website. Please consult the attached "parent instruction guide" 
to activate Zoom and enter the game room.

Please also take a look at the attached consent information and read it carefully. 
You won't have to sign anything, but at the beginning of the session we will ask you 
whether you have read and understood this information to get your verbal consent. The key 
information in this form is that your child's data will be securely stored and will only 
be used for research purposes, and that you or your child can stop playing at any time.

One final note - It is very important that your child interacts with our researchers 
WITHOUT any input from you! These are scientific studies disguised as child-friendly games, 
and for adults they might seem "silly" at times; sometimes if your child is slow 
to respond, you may want to chime in. But please try to let your child interact with our  
researchers, and refrain from talking, laughing, pointing, or asking questions. Thank you   
for your cooperation and we would be happy to answer any questions after the study is over.  

You will receive a confirmation email 24 hours before our meeting with the Zoom link. In 
this meantime, let us know if you have any further questions!

We look forward to playing with you and [child's name]!

Sincerely,
__NAME___
